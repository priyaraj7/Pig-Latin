##### Rules of Pig-Latin

_For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end._

_For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay"._

_If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!_

_For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant._
